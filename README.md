# Icarus
IEEE INTUITION v8 <br>
Hello Everyone, we are Icarus from NTU and we are a bunch of aspiring Software Engineers.<br><br>
We noticed a need for medical personnel over the rise of COVID-19 in Singapore and saw a niche and the need to automate processes in order to alleviate pressure on their already immense workload. <br>

We thought of a simple idea to help Singapore's doctors issue Medical Certificates (MC) through the use of a Telegram Bot alongside a Cloud Service.
We built a Convolutional Neural Network to help with Image Classification and through the use of keras/tensorflow and python scripting, we predict on an image fed to us to determine the status of the submission (i.e. whether to give an MC or not.)
