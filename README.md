# Icarus
IEEE INTUITION v8 \n
Hello Everyone, we are Icarus from NTU and we are a bunch of aspiring Software Engineers.\n\n
We noticed a need for medical personnel over the rise of COVID-19 in Singapore and it is noticed a niche and need to automate processes in order to alleviate the pressures on their workload. \n
We thought of a simple idea to help Singapore's doctors issue Medical Certificates (MC) through the use of a Telegram Bot alongside a Cloud Service. \n
We built a Convolutional Neural Network to help with Image Classification and through the use of keras/tensorflow and a self made program, we predict on an image fed to us to determine the status of the submission (i.e. whether to give an Medical Certificate or not.)
