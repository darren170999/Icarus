# Icarus
IEEE INTUITION v8
Hello Everyone, we are Icarus from NTU and we are a bunch of aspiring Software Engineers.
We noticed a need for medical personel over the rise of COVID 19 and it is prevalent that we address the need to automate processes in order to alleviate the pressures on their workload.
We thought of a simple idea to help Singapore's doctors issue Medical Certificates through the use of a Telegram Bot as well as a Cloud Service.
We built a Convolutional Neural Network to help with Image Classification and through the use of keras and a self made program, we predict on an image fed to us to determine the status of the submission (i.e. whether to give an Medical Certificate or not.)
